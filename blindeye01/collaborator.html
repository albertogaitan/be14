        <br>
        <b>Benton-C Bainbridge</b> </b>has been working in cinema & related media 
        since 1983. For the past decade, Benton-C has approached cinema as a performable 
        medium, making audio and video in realtime in a multitude of group and 
        solo contexts. Currently, Bainbridge has become a partner in the "blind 
        eye project." He collaborated with Scott Holmquist [aka, willy mal] in 
        finding technical solutions in the production of "exoptic fields" and 
        created the blind eye media's second production, "blind heat." Part of 
        the blind eye projects. Even in his earliest Super-8 film work, Benton-C 
        sought immediate means to create cinema, finding little satisfaction in 
        single frame animation. Video offered a shorter feedback loop, as tape 
        allowed for rehearsals and rapid refinements. In 1989, working with David 
        Jones' unique A/V synthesis instruments at upstate New York's Experimental 
        Television Center confirmed Bainbridge's belief that video is meant to 
        be played, like a visual form of music. Like music, performed cinema is 
        commonly a collaborative art form. During the '90s, Bainbridge co-founded 
        the groups 77 Hz (with Jonathan 'Naval Cassidy' Giles, Philip R. Bonner, 
        Michael Schell and Eric Schefter), The Poool (with Angie Eng and Nancy 
        Meli Walker), and NNeng (with Nancy Meli Walker and Brian Moran) to perform 
        improvised and composed video live on stage. Bainbridge has worked with 
        DanceKumikoKimoto, Ikue Mori, Abigail Child, Maria Beatty, Zeena Parkins, 
        David Weinstein, Nick Didkovsky, Gen Ken Montgomery, 99 Hooker, Hoppy 
        Kamiyama, Elise Kermani, David Linton, Hahn Rowe, Ron Anderson & The Molecules, 
        Jason Kao Hwang, Liminal Projects, Anney Bonney, Barbara Held, Eugene 
        Thacker, Bill Etra and dozens of other artists. As his alter-ego "Valued 
        Cu$tomer", Benton-C has pursued a parallel live omnimedia career, co-founding 
        the groups Lord Knows Compost (with Philip R. "Bulk Foodveyor" Bonner) 
        and Stackable Thumb (with Jonathan "Naval Cassidy" Giles). Lord Knows 
        Compost was founded in 1983, and works mostly with video, music, web art, 
        comix, animatronic puppetry, long-term food decay and Class "Insecta". 
        The live A/V duo Stackable Thumb performs rapid-change slapstick with 
        an array of low tech and broken machinery in an ongoing lament over the 
        failure of the Space Program to bring space flight to the people. Benton-C 
        Bainbridge has performed, screened, streamed, broadcast and installed 
        video world wide over the wires and airwaves and in museums, galleries, 
        clubs, colleges and festivals including the Whitney Museum of American 
        Art at Philip Morris (NYC), Museum of Modern Art (NYC), Mercat des les 
        Flores (Barcelona), Uplink Factory (Tokyo), Anthology Film Archives (NYC), 
        The Kitchen (NYC), Blasthaus (San Francisco), STEIM (Amsterdam), Metafort 
        d'Aubervilliers (Paris), Miami Light Project, Dallas Video Festival, and 
        Hotwired (World Wide Web). In 1997 Benton-C launched the website Pulsating 
        OKAY! as an information nexus on realtime cinema and performed video. 
        More recently he has been designing and constructing analog & digital 
        A/V synthesis sytems with Bill Etra and designing 'Movie Jukeboxes' with 
        various artists, engineers and programmers. In 2001, Benton-C will focus 
        on video portraiture and experimental narratives.<b><br>

      <p><b> Abigail Child</b> is a film and video maker whose original montage 
        pushes the envelope of sound-image relations with sensitivity, smarts 
        and passion. Her work in the 80s explores gender while focusing on strategies 
        for rewriting narrative, creating the cult classics "Mayhem" and "Covert 
        Action" while her 1990s productions recuperate documentary to poetically 
        explore public space. Her recent film Surface NOISE (2000) was featured 
        at the New York Film Festival last fall and her new DARK DARK (2001) premiered 
        at this year1s NYFF. o She has exhibited her award-winning art extensively 
        in both solo and group shows, including The American Century, 1950-2000 
        at the Whitney Museum, the Whitney Biennial (1989 + 97), the New York 
        Film Festival & Video Side Bar (1989 + 1993), and the London, Rotterdam, 
        Pesaro, and Torino Film Festivals, among others. She is author of several 
        books of poetry (A Motive for Mayhem, Mob and Scatter Matrix most recently). 
        Her films have been shown on television both here and abroad and for her 
        media work, Child has received Fellowships from the Guggenheim and Fulbright 
        Foundations, ITVS "American Narratives", NEA Interarts, the Jerome Foundation, 
        Massachusetts Arts Council, Creative Artists Foundations, and multiple 
        grants from from New York Foundation for the Arts and New York State Council 
        for the Arts. Her films are in the permanent collection of The Museum 
        of Modern Art, New York and the Centre Pompidou, Paris: her work has been 
        written about in The New York Times, The Village Voice, LA Times, AfterImage, 
        LA Weekly, San Francisco Bay Guardian, Toronto Globe among others. Child 
        studied History & Literature at Radcliffe College and graduated with a 
        MFA from Yale University School of the Arts. She has taught film/video 
        production & history at various schools, including New York University 
        School of the Arts, San Francisco Art Institute, Hampshire College and 
        Sarah Lawrence, as well as a writing workshop at the Kootenay School of 
        Writing in Vancouver (1991). She is currently Chair of the Film Area at 
        the Museum School of Fine Arts in Boston. <br>

      <b>Naval Cassidy</b> is an instant cinema artist who works with groups Stackable 
      Thumb and Naval Cassidy and the Hands of Orlak, a new group that combines 
      live video with live percussion. His video works and performances have traveled 
      the world; most recently in Berlin, Ottowa, Dallas, and Hamburg.<br>
      In 1993, Cassidy won a Jerome Foundation grant to create a world wide web 
      site called "The Miserable Racetrack" that was at the time one of the few 
      web based artworks. Recently, he began doing gallery shows and small performances 
      at the Williamsburg Front Room. He calls this chamber video, trying to emphasize 
      the possibilities of small intimate exhibitions/performances for up to four 
      people at a time.<br>

      <b>willy mal</b> is a pseudonym for New York based writer-researcher.<br>
      <br>
      Since the mid 1980's willy mal has been developing the idea of "deflective" 
      media. An early piece was "Papal Rap" which was featured at the "Popening" 
      in San Francisco, 1987, and the Progressive Film and Video Festival, Berkeley, 
      1987. <br><br>
      Since 2000, he's worked to promote and produce purely "deflective" media, 
      including "exoptic fields" which has been marketed as an "art product for 
      home use" a "video to end all videos" in the Utne Reader. The "exoptic fields" 
      video was also featured at the November 2000 Transcinema art show at the 
      Here Art Gallery, NYC. <br><br>
      Most recently mal organized the "deflective art and media extravaganza" 
      at the Chashama space in Times Square, NYC, that ran through January 2002 
      He has installed "deflective media" storefronts around Manhattan since Spring 2001. 
      Other storefront commissions 
      include those at "schikaneder" gallery-cafe in Vienna, Austria, 
      opened 4 January 2002, and at "gallerythe.org" in Brooklyn, NY, opened 23 January 
      through 7 March 2002. He also designed and runs this website.<br>
