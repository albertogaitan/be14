Among other actions, the project sells radical "art" videos

storefronts, street-stand "selling" performances and
"advertising." These, and related undertakings, are all part
of the blind eye project.

media logic
</b><br>
  Media reversal and deflection are like sound wave
cancellation techniques. They seek to neutralize sensation
by creating its opposite. In the case of sound, this
opposite is a wave that saps the energy of the existing
sound. Think of a bath tub where equal and opposite waves
collide and
  cancel each other leading to a still tub.
  The action, its process, cancels stimulation. <a

origins</b>
<br>
  The "ambient revolution" idea sprang from willy mal's
enthusiasm for the rapid
  changes that occurred in tv, including the news, during
the 1980s. The
  striking progression of sensation-driven tv programming
promised to
  undermine tv's authority in public life and, under the
transformations
  wrought by the ongoing "ambient revolution," to transform
tv into nothing more
  or less than an ambient emotion emitter with a selection
dial.

target="_self">Complete manifesto.</a>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a
name="the_project"></a><b>the
  blind eye project's mission</b><br>
   The project
advocates
  a complete aesthetic reversal, where experiments in
"deflection" and de-stimulation might lead to a practical,
even
decorative,
  liberatory aesthetic for our time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To this end,
the project seeks to promote techniques for benign sensory
negation, "deflection," in
  electronic media. Such deflective media strive to subtract
all
stimulation.
  And by so reversing the fundamental principle of nearly
all media, which is attraction/stimulation,
  the project seeks to provoke radical departures in media
and design on par
  with those that followed the development of expressionist
painting and the discovery
  of microbial life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this regard
the project
is
like any previous avant-garde. Only more so. It proposes
nothing less than the final avant garde. It proposes a
complete flip Art
and
Media
  on their heads, as these have been understood throughout
human
history.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Media
reversal, or
negation,
pops
  the media issue out of the conventional media loop.
Outside, where the
project
  works to inspire an aesthetic movement. A movement with
new pleasures.
A
movement
  that's tough enough to disrupt and resist the electronic
media
juggernaut
that's
  now enveloping human life around the globe for better or
worse.

gifts to

  people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In fact, the
laughter and understandings or confusions that
arise
from
  such gift exchanges are the essence of the project's
public

"High

irony.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> These videos
work best as
gifts
  because when you offer one to someone,
you
emphasize
  its intention. Which is primarily "deflection." As in,
"Hey, my very dear couch-potato, check
this
out. Video for tv made deliberately to make you
look
away!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">
  That's why the exoptic fields box is like a greeting card.

important

  <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The "ambient
revolution" idea
sprang
  from willy mal's enthusiasm for the rapid changes that
occurred in tv,
including
  the news, during the 1980s. The striking progression of
sensation-driven
tv
  programming promised to undermine tv's authority in public
life and,
under
the
  transformations wrought by the ongoing ambient revolution,
to
transform tv
into
  nothing more or less than an ambient emotion emitter with
a selection
dial. From whence the term: "ambient revolution."
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This
revolution required
no
agitators.
  Over the years the idea evolved in correspondence and
conversation
among a
small
  group of movie-media producers and intellectuals.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the
mid-1990s, mal
proposed
marketing
  videos called "look away tv" as an extension of the
ambient
revolution,
but
  he found no backers. That work on "look away tv" became
the foundation
of
"the
  blind eye project." But the blind eye project went beyond
the ambient
revolution
  by recognizing contemporary movie-media producers as the
greatest
seducers
of
  all time. And by realizing that this continuous seduction
in media
called
for
  its opposite. The original "look away tv" recognized this
idea of
reversal
but
  not its implications. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then, in 1997,
after a
secret
all-night
  conference of self-described media druids and moguls in a
San
Francisco
mansion
  over the Pacific, willy mal formulated a critical
departure in the
blind
eye
  manifesto. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was useless
to deny the joys of perfectly attractive and
diverse
  media. So why resist? Why? Because from inside the all
absorbing
mediasphere
  there is no way to observe it, no critical outpost from
which to check
its
progress.
  Therefore, to gain such critical distance the blind eye
project
advocated
total
  media reversal. A complete media logic flip. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In early 2000,
willy mal
set
up
  blind eye media, llc, to produce the following: <br>
  o the
"exoptic
  fields" video <br>
  o the exoptic fields magazine advertisement campaign in
the Utne Reader.<br>
  o an example of deflective media with added stimulation,
the "blind
heat"
video
  made by Benton C. <br>
  o the "exoptic fields" installation at TRANSCINEMA in the
HERE
art
gallery
  in New York City end of November 2000. <br>
  o blind eye storefronts in New York City, London, and
Vienna. In New York, the East Village window at C-Ya!, 524
East 5th St., between Ave's "A" and "B" and the Times Square

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>extended
discussion</b>
<br>
  The "ambient revolution" was also a response to spirited
mid-1980s
debates
about
  "public interest" television. The revolution saw TV
evolving into a
kind
of
  pure emotion emitter with a selection dial that viewers
could use like
a
pump
  for an undiluted emotion-altering drug. And that made
reforming
television
to
  serve the public interest futile. In this analysis, tv was
simply not
suited
  for more than superficial, emotion driven education or
politics.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the ambient

revolutionary
way
  of thinking, the so-called MTV-ization of tv and
increasingly
sensational
tv
  news reporting were good for a democratic society because
these trends
undermined
  the authority of a medium that is inherently bad as a
forum for
analyzing
and
  debating important social questions. That's why the
ambient revolution
needed
  no agitators. "Natural" market pressures to pull in larger
audience
shares
and
  profit-driven changes in technology have been successfully
demolishing serious tv
for
twenty
  years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Beyond the
"ambient revolutionary thinking," the blind eye project
makes no
intellectual
  excuses for inaction. It advocates and carries out media
reversal as a
radical
  departure from the expanding and heaving and fabulous
media
monstrosity
that's
  on the verge of encompassing more and more of humanity's
daily
experience.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With media
reversal, the
blind
eye
  project flips the idea of media upside down, entirely
breaking away
from
the
  stalemate over "good" versus "bad" media. But not breaking
away in
order
to
  "kill your TV"-though that's always a good option.
Instead, the blind
eye
project
  advocates an active media position entirely outside
existing media
frameworks.
  But one that makes useful electronic media. One where
media's first
objective
  is to SUBTRACT stimulation in the visual field, usually by
deflection.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a
name="reversing"></a>media-logic
  reversal payoff </b><br>
  One speculative consequence of media negation, or
subtracting
stimulation,
can
  be to heighten the experience of remaining sensations. In
other words,
media
  reversal proposes an aesthetics and tools that promote
experiences
OTHER
than
  those offered by the media themselves! That is the
reversed media
logic
payoff.
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>reversing
media logic
compared
  to sound wave cancellation </b></font><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One way to
think about
media
reversal
  and deflection is to compare them to sound wave
cancellation. In
helicopter
  headphones, noise is canceled by reproducing inverted
sound waves that
match
  the cockpit's loud ambient sounds. This works the same way
waves
sometimes
meet
  in water and suddenly go flat behind passing boats. Waves
with energy
pulling
  in opposite directions cancel each other out. Though light
waves or
particles
  that stimulate the sensation of vision may act similar to
sound waves,
this
  analogy is not perfect. To literally cancel what comes
from a TV or
movie
screen
  would require anticipating and broadcasting equal and
opposing light
waves
simultaneously.
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The blind eye
project
doesn't
attempt
  to literally cancel light waves, but this ideal of
perfectly negating
the
screen
  is central to the project. As is the idea that by negating
a the field
of
visual
  stimulation, all other stimulation might be heightened.
