</font></B><FONT FACE="Times"> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Let me tell you how the daylight 
  soothed our eyes.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All night we fought and paced and 
  scrawled notes on butcher-paper torn and tacked up, draped and wrinkling from 
  room to room.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our deadline? The sky through Victorian 
  windows. Their glass our mirror till morning. Winking back the dread.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fierce love&#146;s deepest dread. 
  Dread beyond humanity&#146;s words and machines and gerry rigged DNA. The dread 
  of your mind&#146;s very eyes and ears and heart. </font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thrown out the bright copper doors 
  we blinked at the sky and the stars were gone. We blinked. We BLINKED and LOOKED 
  AWAY while the billionaires and celebrities amongst us scurried to the street 
  and hurried to waiting cars. </font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now these lines are left to me. 
  This call to action! Our credo. Our <br>
  Blind Eye Manifesto!</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">MANIFESTO?!</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Who could read a manifesto today?</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You hear "manifesto" and you smell 
  the smoky rot of manifestoes&#146; murdered and burnt bodies still strong and 
  still putrefying in the throat of humanity&#146;s last utopian gasps.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So who now dares write a manifesto?</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nobody. Call me nobody. Nobody who 
  asks:</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Have you seen the blood soaked<br>
  Manifesto Repository where<br>
  Manifesto Theater and<br>
  Manifesto Film and<br>
  Manifesto Television and<br>
  Manifesto Liberation Computer Networking flicker with Bertolt Brecht in red 
  wax, crude thinking and cutting out Brigitte Bardot&#146;s black rubber heart 
  while Noam Chomsky applauds and Steven Spielberg in chains weeps and ex-Chairman 
  Bill Gates plays the late night cold-food plastic-wrap salesman. And the orchestra 
  pit is filled with broken skulls and blood because, &#145;You have to break 
  a few eggs to make an omelet!&#146;</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Still nobody I repeat:</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Blast fools that anchor their minds 
  in sweet book-mold vaults and tremble terrified that tv demons will leap from 
  gutters to dirty their cotton sheets.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Blast fools that explode their brains 
  on the ray-tube speedway&#146;s closed tracks whose spinning back-drops are 
  choked with electric ozone smog.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And blast fools trapped in the vortex.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ah, clever reader! Now you smell 
  old manifestoes&#146; stinky feet, don&#146;t you? If only YOU had NOTHING TO 
  LOOSE BUT YOUR CHAINS . . . Instead you dream that you too feel and taste your 
  Sudanese wet-nurse.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Good nose! Fine tongue!</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our fight is the old fight, the 
  hopeless struggle. But seek ye not citare herein for this is NOT scholarship.</font> 
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times"> <br>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our combat is the total war of love. 
Our technique annihilates television, movies, the academy, museums, galleries 
and the internet. How we love them all. How we love tv, the greatest enemy. Tv, 
where flow perfect (and imperfect) bodies in perfect (and imperfect) light through 
perfect (and imperfect) shade to perfect (and imperfect) sounds, stories, and 
words, yes, WORDS, that all insist:<br>
Look here.<br>
Look now.<br>
Look again.</font> 
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Exoptic, our tv-attack missiles 
  detonate on screen and you look away. You rather notice dust bunnies swirl below 
  the glowing raster.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our love&#146;s affection demolishes. 
  Our trillion pairs of lips pursed and pressing obliterate tv and every Art Expo. 
  They pulverize the most compelling Cinema, the final Theory and the deadliest 
  Killer-App Linked Web Page.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As artists and intellectuals, amateurs 
  and professionals, we detest ART. We agree with Picasso, "Neither trust paid 
  generals to rule in war nor artists to reign over art!" </font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For beauty is greed&#146;s eager 
  slave.</font></P>
</FONT>
<hr width="60%" align="center">
<br>
<FONT FACE="Times"> 
<P></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Look where you are. Squint into 
  the distance. All that you see shines. All that you see comes coated by Movie 
  Era eye-plasma. You stand upon the pulsing eyeballs of the moving picture era, 
  staring. There you spy re-play and re-production perfected.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1 picture = 1000 words<br>
  If only.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now feel the sun. Now feel hate. 
  Now feel love. Now feel lust. What images for that in the
  world? What talkie-image for vidiphone interconnectedness, maestro?</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The great wave crashed and brought 
  the movies.<br>
  Another television.<br>
  One more the Web.</font></P>

<hr width="60%" align="center">
<FONT FACE="Times">
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our heavy metal uranium bullets 
  will pierce all ironic armor in techno color. For we are not ironic today.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Iron we cast in our guts, steeled 
  to stomach the false hopes of others that this horny and bucking info-scape 
  can be tamed by some nouveau Lord Riley's sense of Public Interest. (For there 
  is no educational tv.)</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because we sink in pleasure when 
  tv&#146;s flower opens and its petals flutter over our hearts and caress each 
  organ. Because the medium is the MASSAGE.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Awake again, hung over, and back 
  to war, we dynamite the message of the medium.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our tactic is utter surrender to 
  the embedded ideology of tv&#146;s technology.<br>
  There, we strain the fibers of our terrible core, bend to snapping bows, catapults 
  and fingers on the trigger of black market ex-Soviet psychological weaponry.<br>
  In those heating arcs we stock the counter-force.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The unrelenting flow and total intimacy 
  of the tv world, beware. Our daggers touch your throat, kosher daggers so sharp 
  that you feel only an itch under your chin when your jugular opens . . .<br>
  Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssslit! </font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Dead Marcuse,</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We can never have only one dimension. 
  And technological rationality is no enemy. But that&#146;s another manifesto.<br>
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our movement is irresistible. These 
  times grant us an arsenal for refusal. A sublime NEIN! Nothing. No guilt therapy. 
  No hugs. No anti-depressant. No sex therapy. No nada will grease loose our friction. 
  Our conflict is inextinguishable. We can never merge in BALANCE and contentment.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Herr Marcuse, your one-dimensional 
  nightmare is the living ghost we dispatch and exalt. We evoke the eternal gap 
  whose death you grieved too early! Here, at last, we declare war on all media.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is a manifesto for a time beyond 
  manifestoes. A time that aches to hear its own voice and see its own face but 
  keeps on looking at the television above the bar.</font></P>
<P> </P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Filmmakers, video makers and anyone 
  who watches, behold the rhythm of your time and shake it. Stomp down the springs 
  on the light TRAP.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is no option.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Seize the deflective lightning and 
  hurl it before you! Conjure each movement, color, form and light to divert and 
  release any eyes. Or perish choked on puddles of excremental glow-dabblings 
  and tinker toy installations from the dead avant-garde.</font></P>
