Many hundred walked by outside,                and visitors included a large number of these passersby. Responses               were vigorous.

His piece considered the idea               of exciting physical passions while deflecting the direct viewer-attention.               Visitors sat on the bed, felt the woofer kick and touched the video-flickered               sheets. </font></p>            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The "<b>exoptitron</b>"               playing "exoptic fields," by mal, includes moveable magnifying lenses               that invite manipulation and focus.

Banners in the installation made the piece's central               intention explicit: to consider deflection as a media objective               as opposed to "attraction." </font></p>            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Jean-Philippe Baert</b>               also exhibited a video version of his TV "<b>fossil</b>" made by               exposing photo paper to television screens during news broadcasts.                A video loop of one such piece played on a 5" screen. </font></p>             <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other work included                <b>Steven Katz</b>' 15-foot sculpture, "<b>peer</b>"; <b>Bob Gill</b>'s               design for the "exoptic fields" video box, installed by willy mal;               a storefront window by <b>Nathalie Adamidi</b> and willy mal; a               video loop of Benton Bainbridge and Naval Cassidy speaking on a               Canadian TV program describing "deflective" media and the "blind               eye projects." </font></p>            <p><b>2)</b> On 24 January 2002, the performances started about 8:30pm               before an audience of 65 people. <b>Naval Cassidy</b>'s performance,               the first, followed his proposed design and included an assistant.               Cassidy communicated detailed instructions to the audience via printed-text                on paper strips drawn under a camera and displayed on a large TV                monitor. These messages were mixed with other images produced and               captured live. The printed instructions prepared the audience for               a series of "demonstrations" on "looking" and "looking away." These               involved objects viewed by camera and direct, as well as objects               thrown into the audience. The assistant used a tiny hand-held camera               to his eye, for instance, to illustrate the procedure. This image               appeared with the image of a clock used as the map of for eye-directions               in one of the demonstrations. The audience could see Cassidy monitor               his actions on a second screen above his long table of props. </p>             <p><b>Abigail Child</b>'s "Best of Both Worlds" was a comparatively                spare counterpoint to Naval's calculated barrage. She and her assistant               dressed in white smocks and black crotch-harnessed belts, miming               lab technicians or electricians, positioned - and repositioned -               themselves both casually and deliberately to reflect the light of               TV monitors and to catch the projection of a film that was reflected               off a Mylar wall onto a white screen. Two TV monitors, in sync,               were tuned manually by Child, and assistant Fernanda Affonseca,               to broadcast programming. These were often left tuned to distorted               and rolling images but would surface occasionally into a realizable                broadcast image. A third much larger screen played back a crisp                video of city winter skyscapes, of roofs, smoking furnace stacks,                rhymed with clouds rolling in real time across the frame. It included               sound and had both a passive and faintly sinister overtone [the               storm approaches] though its references were largely to the quotidian               and diurnal exterior world. The film projector ran a sex scene from               a 1970s pornographic film in which a man describes being penetrated               by a woman wearing a "strap-on" dildo. Near the end of the piece               we hear him state: "...It was like having the best of both worlds..."               A third musical source played a minimal rapid-beat of synthesized                music. The issues raised in the performance, inspired by the Exoptic                Theme, include: the narrative force of the body; the body as obstacle               and desire; ideas of INTERFERENCE; the competing textures of the               mediated visual world as techno fuzz, window, and/or deflected projection               [the reflected screen]; the contrast of attention between the exterior               and the interior, between the 'real' and the mediated, between what               can be 'tuned' and what continues despite human ' interference.'               All this with a crackling ironic humor bubbling underneath. </p>            <p><b>Fritz Donnelly</b>'s "Very Special Performance Tonight Only"                opened with a video of himself as a TV language instructor giving                a series of lessons in a made-up language that sounded like Italian               or Russian. He then appears, in person, as the language instructor               and gives a lesson, inviting an audience member to participate.               He invites the audience to repeat after him, and has many speaking               this new language. In effect he "re-edits" the video tape in-vivo,               on stage. Then he leaves stage to return as another character speaking               a different made-up language and proceeds to rap in that Chinese-sounding                language, pushing the "edit" to distortion.</p>            <p><b>Benton-C</b>'s "blind heat: stasis & storm mix" positioned a                large TV monitor on the floor, about center-stage, facing away from                the audience to a Mylar wall. Benton-C launched a live re-mix of               "blind heat" that included music that played on the TV, reflected               in the wall or seen from the edges by the audience. Benton-C sat               at a table on stage before his laptop and other equipment with glowing               dials. Anita Durst appeared in a bride's white dress, walked behind               the TV to position herself to crawl and drag herself slowly over               the monitor. Her dress's folds reflected its pulsing light. For               more than ten minutes she pulled herself directly toward the back               wall, over the top of the set. While prone, propped on her elbows               with her thighs still resting on the TV-top, she proceeded to smoke                in this position before pulling herself completely off the set,                rolling to the side and standing. She made several walking turns                then left the stage.</p>          </td>          <td><img src="./images/eye-fld-drmtic"> </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/open-42ndStdancer+bones.jpg">            </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/x-trn-dtl1.jpg" width="280" height="360">           </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td width="50%"><img src="images/x-trn-whle.jpg"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td> <img src="./images/x-peer-angle.jpg" width="250" height="400">           </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/x-code-boxes.jpg" width="250" height="180">           </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td><img src="./images/x-bxes-peer-bd.jpg">           </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/extra-naval-perf1.jpg" width="250" height="240"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/extra-child-perf3.jpg" width="240" height="220"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/extra-child-perf1.jpg" width="240" height="65"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/extra-fritz-perf1.jpg" width="240" height="300"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/extra-bb-perf2.jpg" width="240" height="120"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td><img src="./images/extr-bb-perf1.jpg" width="240" height="160"></td>        </tr>      </table>      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><font size="2"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="about.html">about</a>         | <a href="./chashama.html">events+exhibits</a>          | </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a href="./science.html">the         science</a><font color="#000000"> | <a href="storefronts.html">storefronts</a></font>         | <a href="./videos.html">videos</a></b></font></font></font>         <img src="./images/lft_bones.gif" width="80" height="100">       </p>      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000"><b><a href="./contact.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">contact</font></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">         <font color="#000000">|</font> <a href="./demo.html">deflect         demo</a><font color="#000000"> |</font> <a href="./previewnew.html">exoptic         preview</a> </font> </b></font></p>      <p align="center">       <p>     </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="79%" td align="left" halign="left" valign="top" height="14">Å@</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
