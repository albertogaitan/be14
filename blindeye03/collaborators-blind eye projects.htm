      <P><B><BR><BR><B>Benton-C Bainbridge</B> </B>has been working in cinema 
      &amp; related media since 1983. For the past decade, Benton-C has 
      approached cinema as a performable medium, making audio and video in 
      realtime in a multitude of group and solo contexts. Currently, Bainbridge 
      has become a partner in the "blind eye project." He collaborated with 
      Scott Holmquist [aka, willy mal] in finding technical solutions in the 
      production of "exoptic fields" and created the blind eye media's second 
      production, "blind heat." Part of the blind eye projects. Even in his 
      earliest Super-8 film work, Benton-C sought immediate means to create 
      cinema, finding little satisfaction in single frame animation. Video 
      offered a shorter feedback loop, as tape allowed for rehearsals and rapid 
      refinements. In 1989, working with David Jones' unique A/V synthesis 
      instruments at upstate New York's Experimental Television Center confirmed 
      Bainbridge's belief that video is meant to be played, like a visual form 
      of music. Like music, performed cinema is commonly a collaborative art 
      form. During the '90s, Bainbridge co-founded the groups 77 Hz (with 
      Jonathan 'Naval Cassidy' Giles, Philip R. Bonner, Michael Schell and Eric 
      Schefter), The Poool (with Angie Eng and Nancy Meli Walker), and NNeng 
      (with Nancy Meli Walker and Brian Moran) to perform improvised and 
      composed video live on stage. Bainbridge has worked with 
      DanceKumikoKimoto, Ikue Mori, Abigail Child, Maria Beatty, Zeena Parkins, 
      David Weinstein, Nick Didkovsky, Gen Ken Montgomery, 99 Hooker, Hoppy 
      Kamiyama, Elise Kermani, David Linton, Hahn Rowe, Ron Anderson &amp; The 
      Molecules, Jason Kao Hwang, Liminal Projects, Anney Bonney, Barbara Held, 
      Eugene Thacker, Bill Etra and dozens of other artists. As his alter-ego 
      "Valued Cu$tomer", Benton-C has pursued a parallel live omnimedia career, 
      co-founding the groups Lord Knows Compost (with Philip R. "Bulk Foodveyor" 
      Bonner) and Stackable Thumb (with Jonathan "Naval Cassidy" Giles). Lord 
      Knows Compost was founded in 1983, and works mostly with video, music, web 
      art, comix, animatronic puppetry, long-term food decay and Class 
      "Insecta". The live A/V duo Stackable Thumb performs rapid-change 
      slapstick with an array of low tech and broken machinery in an ongoing 
      lament over the failure of the Space Program to bring space flight to the 
      people. Benton-C Bainbridge has performed, screened, streamed, broadcast 
      and installed video world wide over the wires and airwaves and in museums, 
      galleries, clubs, colleges and festivals including the Whitney Museum of 
      American Art at Philip Morris (NYC), Museum of Modern Art (NYC), Mercat 
      des les Flores (Barcelona), Uplink Factory (Tokyo), Anthology Film 
      Archives (NYC), The Kitchen (NYC), Blasthaus (San Francisco), STEIM 
      (Amsterdam), Metafort d'Aubervilliers (Paris), Miami Light Project, Dallas 
      Video Festival, and Hotwired (World Wide Web). In 1997 Benton-C launched 
      the website Pulsating OKAY! as an information nexus on realtime cinema and 
      performed video. More recently he has been designing and constructing 
      analog &amp; digital A/V synthesis sytems with Bill Etra and designing 
      'Movie Jukeboxes' with various artists, engineers and programmers. In 
      2001, Benton-C will focus on video portraiture and experimental 
      narratives.<B><BR></B></P>
      <P><B>Abigail Child</B> is a film and video maker whose original montage 
      pushes the envelope of sound-image relations with sensitivity, smarts and 
      passion. Her work in the 80s explores gender while focusing on strategies 
      for rewriting narrative, creating the cult classics "Mayhem" and "Covert 
      Action" while her 1990s productions recuperate documentary to poetically 
      explore public space. Her recent film Surface NOISE (2000) was featured at 
      the New York Film Festival last fall and her new DARK DARK (2001) 
      premiered at this year1s NYFF. o She has exhibited her award-winning art 
      extensively in both solo and group shows, including The American Century, 
      1950-2000 at the Whitney Museum, the Whitney Biennial (1989 + 97), the New 
      York Film Festival &amp; Video Side Bar (1989 + 1993), and the London, 
      Rotterdam, Pesaro, and Torino Film Festivals, among others. She is author 
      of several books of poetry (A Motive for Mayhem, Mob and Scatter Matrix 
      most recently). Her films have been shown on television both here and 
      abroad and for her media work, Child has received Fellowships from the 
      Guggenheim and Fulbright Foundations, ITVS "American Narratives", NEA 
      Interarts, the Jerome Foundation, Massachusetts Arts Council, Creative 
      Artists Foundations, and multiple grants from from New York Foundation for 
      the Arts and New York State Council for the Arts. Her films are in the 
      permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Centre 
      Pompidou, Paris: her work has been written about in The New York Times, 
      The Village Voice, LA Times, AfterImage, LA Weekly, San Francisco Bay 
      Guardian, Toronto Globe among others. Child studied History &amp; 
      Literature at Radcliffe College and graduated with a MFA from Yale 
      University School of the Arts. She has taught film/video production &amp; 
      history at various schools, including New York University School of the 
      Arts, San Francisco Art Institute, Hampshire College and Sarah Lawrence, 
      as well as a writing workshop at the Kootenay School of Writing in 
      Vancouver (1991). She is currently Chair of the Film Area at the Museum

      York based writer-researcher.<BR><BR>Since the mid 1980's willy mal has 
      been developing the idea of "deflective" media. An early piece was "Papal 
      Rap" which was featured at the "Popening" in San Francisco, 1987, and the 
      Progressive Film and Video Festival, Berkeley, 1987. <BR><BR>Since 2000, 
      he's worked to promote and produce purely "deflective" media, including 
      "exoptic fields" which has been marketed as an "art product for home use" 
      a "video to end all videos" in the Utne Reader. The "exoptic fields" video 
      was also featured at the November 2000 Transcinema art show at the Here 
      Art Gallery, NYC. <BR><BR>Most recently mal organized the "deflective art 
      and media extravaganza" at the Chashama space in Times Square, NYC, that 
      ran through January 2002 He has installed "deflective media" storefronts 
      around Manhattan since Spring 2001. Other storefront commissions include 
      those at "schikaneder" gallery-cafe in Vienna, Austria, opened 4 January 
      2002, and at "gallerythe.org" in Brooklyn, NY, opened 23 January through 7 
      March 2002. He also designed and runs this website.<BR><FONT
