      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The "<b>EXTRAVAGANZA</b>" 
        began in November 2001 with the installation of a storefront window facing 
        42nd street and an art exhibit inside (1), and on January 24th 2002, a 
        live video and performance(2).</font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By February 2002 the "<b>EXTRAVAGANZA</b>" 
        expanded to include storefronts in Vienna, Austria, and Brooklyn, NY.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1)</b> </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        art exhibit featured <b>willy mal</b>, <b>Benton-C Bainbridge</b>, <b>Steven Katz</b>, <b>Jean-Philippe Baert</b>, <b>Nathalie Adamidi</b> and <b>Bob Gill</b>,
        among others. Opening night attracked over <b>100 visitors</b>.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Bainbridge's "<b>blind heat</b>" 
        installation included a bed. The bed's sheets served to reflect projected 
        video from above, and a subwoffer underneath the bed broadcast the video 
        soundtrack. His piece considered the idea of exciting physical passions 
        while deflecting the direct viewer-attention. Visitors sat on the bed, 
        felt the woofer kick and touched the video-flickered sheets. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The "<b>exoptitron</b>" playing 
        "exoptic fields," by mal, includes moveable magnifying lenses that invite 
        manipulation and focus. Visitors responded by moving the lenses. Banners 
        in the installation made the piece's central intention explicit: to consider 
        deflection as a media objective as opposed to "attraction." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Jean-Philippe Baert</b> 
        also exhibited a video version of his TV "<b>fossil</b>" made by exposing 
        photo paper to television screens during news broadcasts. A video loop 
        of one such piece played on a 5" screen. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other work included <b>Steven 
        Katz</b>' 15-foot sculpture, "<b>peer</b>"; <b>Bob Gill</b>'s design for 
        the "exoptic fields" video box, installed by willy mal; a storefront window 
        by <b>Nathalie Adamidi</b> and willy mal; a video loop of Benton Bainbridge 
        and Naval Cassidy speaking on a Canadian TV program describing "deflective" 
        media and the "blind eye projects." </font></p>
      <p><b>2)</b> On 24 January 2002, the performances started about 8:30pm before 
        an audience of 65 people. <b>Naval Cassidy</b>'s performance, the first, 
        followed his proposed design and included an assistant. Cassidy communicated 
        detailed instructions to the audience via printed-text on paper strips 
        drawn under a camera and displayed on a large TV monitor. These messages 
        were mixed with other images produced and captured live. The printed instructions 
        prepared the audience for a series of "demonstrations" on "looking" and 
        "looking away." These involved objects viewed by camera and direct, as 
        well as objects thrown into the audience. The assistant used a tiny hand-held 
        camera to his eye, for instance, to illustrate the procedure. This image 
        appeared with the image of a clock used as the map of for eye-directions 
        in one of the demonstrations. The audience could see Cassidy monitor his 
        actions on a second screen above his long table of props. </p>
      <p><b>Abigail Child</b>'s "Best of Both Worlds" was a comparatively spare 
        counterpoint to Naval's calculated barrage. She and her assistant dressed 
        in white smocks and black crotch-harnessed belts, miming lab technicians 
        or electricians, positioned - and repositioned - themselves both casually 
        and deliberately to reflect the light of TV monitors and to catch the 
        projection of a film that was reflected off a Mylar wall onto a white 
        screen. Two TV monitors, in sync, were tuned manually by Child, and assistant 
        Fernanda Affonseca, to broadcast programming. These were often left tuned 
        to distorted and rolling images but would surface occasionally into a 
        realizable broadcast image. A third much larger screen played back a crisp 
        video of city winter skyscapes, of roofs, smoking furnace stacks, rhymed 
        with clouds rolling in real time across the frame. It included sound and 
        had both a passive and faintly sinister overtone [the storm approaches] 
        though its references were largely to the quotidian and diurnal exterior 
        world. The film projector ran a sex scene from a 1970s pornographic film 
        in which a man describes being penetrated by a woman wearing a "strap-on" 
        dildo. Near the end of the piece we hear him state: "...It was like having 
        the best of both worlds..." A third musical source played a minimal rapid-beat 
        of synthesized music. The issues raised in the performance, inspired by 
        the Exoptic Theme, include: the narrative force of the body; the body 
        as obstacle and desire; ideas of INTERFERENCE; the competing textures 
        of the mediated visual world as techno fuzz, window, and/or deflected 
        projection [the reflected screen]; the contrast of attention between the 
        exterior and the interior, between the 'real' and the mediated, between 
        what can be 'tuned' and what continues despite human ' interference.' 
        All this with a crackling ironic humor bubbling underneath. </p>
      <p><b>Fritz Donnelly</b>'s "Very Special Performance Tonight Only" opened 
        with a video of himself as a TV language instructor giving a series of 
        lessons in a made-up language that sounded like Italian or Russian. He 
        then appears, in person, as the language instructor and gives a lesson, 
        inviting an audience member to participate. He invites the audience to 
        repeat after him, and has many speaking this new language. In effect he 
        "re-edits" the video tape in-vivo, on stage. Then he leaves stage to return 
        as another character speaking a different made-up language and proceeds 
        to rap in that Chinese-sounding language, pushing the "edit" to distortion.</p>
      <p><b>Benton-C</b>'s "blind heat: stasis & storm mix" positioned a large 
        TV monitor on the floor, about center-stage, facing away from the audience 
        to a Mylar wall. Benton-C launched a live re-mix of "blind heat" that 
        included music that played on the TV, reflected in the wall or seen from 
        the edges by the audience. Benton-C sat at a table on stage before his 
        laptop and other equipment with glowing dials. Anita Durst appeared in 
        a bride's white dress, walked behind the TV to position herself to crawl 
        and drag herself slowly over the monitor. Her dress's folds reflected 
        its pulsing light. For more than ten minutes she pulled herself directly 
        toward the back wall, over the top of the set. While prone, propped on 
        her elbows with her thighs still resting on the TV-top, she proceeded 
        to smoke in this position before pulling herself completely off the set, 
        rolling to the side and standing. She made several walking turns then 
        left the stage.</p>
