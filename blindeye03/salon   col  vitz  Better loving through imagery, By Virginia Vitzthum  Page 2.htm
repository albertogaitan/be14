            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>I ask Mal and Bainbridge if they'd 
            test-driven their video for its marketed purpose. Bainbridge 
            composed "Blind Heat" with the inspiration and help of a girlfriend, 
            but they broke up before he finished, so he's only shared the 
            experience thus far with Mr. Left Hand. He thinks his solo session 
            was enhanced by the video but admits it may have been because it 
            made him think of his ex. Mal, married for 12 years, says he and his 
            wife had unusually hot sex while the tape played beside their 
            bed.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>But what else is the exoptic mastermind 
            going to say? I enlisted a horny couple to give it a whirl, and I 
            also watched all 45 minutes myself.</PARA> </P>

            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>I pop the tape in after discussing it with 
            Mal on the phone. He reemphasizes that it's nothing like porn, 
            though enhanced sex is its goal. "You can't expect the tape to do it 
            for you. You've got to do it. It's like if I'm stroking my dick, 
            that's supposed to be pleasurable, but if other factors aren't lined 
            up, it's not."</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>After we hang up, I turn my full, 
            non-peripheral gaze to the screen, where vagina-shaped red blobs 
            pulsate bigger and smaller to a vaguely martial snare drum. The red 
            blobs alternate with black blobs, back and forth on a green 
            background that looks sort of like tendons. After a few minutes, I 
            decide the red blobs are penises despite their female shape and the 
            black blobs are the corresponding holes, but I also see tissues or 
            cells under a microscope. Clusters of white dots cast a slimy sheen 
            on everything.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>The images and sound vary slightly every 
            time, but follow a basic pattern, a 23-second cycle. (I know I'm not 
            using the video sexily enough when Bainbridge and Mal say later that 
            the cycle's news to them; they haven't even timed the intervals.) 
            Each cycle starts out pounding and fizzles into silence as a white 
            lattice flutters down over the images. This shimmering curtain 
            reminds me variously of lace, calcification, veins and orgasms. It 
            keeps me thinking about bodies.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>But the short cycles are the opposite of a 
            build to orgasm, more like small waves that lap onto the shore and 
            recede without ever cresting. Perhaps it's frustration with this 
            aimlessness that's supposed to lead the audience to fool around. 
            Perhaps the narrative arc toward climax is being negated or 
            subtracted by this endless loop, which leads the couple (or 
            self-lover) to fill in that blank.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>At this point, lo and behold, I start to 
            feel a little warm down there. Is it video-inspired lust? Boredom? 
            Work ethic? Self-regard over my clever theorizing? I find I'm not 
            sufficiently ashamed by any of those motivations to keep my pants 
            on.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>But once the exoptic devil has busied my 
            idle hands, the video doesn't move me along. I try squinting, but 
            then it just looks red and green and makes me think of Christmas -- 
            whoa. Christmas not sexy: quick, reprogram! I shut my eyes, but then 
            I'm listening for variations in the cycles, and the sound quickly 
            becomes monotonous. Then I think about what Mal said about the 
            video, specifically the "stroking my dick" part. That's better. 
            Though I like "Blind Heat" as art, I find I actually have to tune it 
            out in order to come. I don't think this is the next Viagra.</PARA> 
            </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>My friends Henry and June (not their real 
            names) are even less convinced. Henry says the sound reminds him of 
            "a relaxation record from the '70s" and the video was "kind of 
            offensive. It looked a little bloody, like cells." June, a musician, 
            said she wanted sounds more overtly sexy, like panting and 
            moaning.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>Both agreed that the looping hindered sex. 
            "At first, the rhythm of it worked with what we were doing," June 
            reports, "but after a while we wound down like clockwork. Making 
            love didn't have the natural ending it usually does." Their session 
            was shorter than usual and ended before the 45-minute tape was over; 
            June says the sex was actually worse than usual.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>She adds that the light flickering on 
            Henry's skin "looked sort of cool, but not nearly as nice as 
            candlelight." Bainbridge also brings up fire in our interview, 
            saying he wanted to "warm up the room visually. Fire was our first 
            television, and I want to take the screen back to its roots. A 
            campfire is not so enveloping you can't talk with the person beside 
            you, and it's great to look at, but eventually you look at the 
            person beside you and notice the light on them."</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>Bainbridge likes my comparison to waves, 
            even though I (and June) found those rhythms stalling the climb 
            toward orgasm. At least waves are natural and not overmediated like 
            so much modern experience, Bainbridge says. "We're so far past the 
            'Plato's cave' shadow metaphor. Now it's like the Xeroxed, scanned 
            JPG of the photograph of the shadow of the reflection on the cave 
            wall. I was trying to reflect more the rhythms inside me that I 
            associate with lovemaking or passion."</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>It <I>is</I> sexy to make love to the sound 
            of ocean waves and in flickering light. And contemplating art can 
            make one, if not specifically horny, at least opened up, receptive, 
            tender. Yet this flickering, whooshing art video isn't sexy to three 
            out of three test subjects, and even its creator may have been 
            fantasizing about his ex. That gap between intent and achievement 
            underscores what huge wind machines the exoptic fields project is 
            tilting at -- not just corporate media, but its seedy cousin 
            pornography.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>By trying to take sex back from its 
            commodifiers, the project follows rabble-rousing avant-garde 
            movements like dada and situationism. The playful gesture is 
            generally the point in such tiny art "revolutions" and "Blind Heat" 
            doesn't aspire to pornography, but still I wonder why the video 
            didn't incite more lust, if only placebo lust.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>Perhaps we should blame the media's genius 
            at creating unquenchable desire -- we've been programmed to respond 
            only to pornographic and advertising images. Or maybe, no matter how 
            often we say we prefer the suggestive to the obvious, we're born 
            needing human bodies (present, depicted or imagined) to reliably 
            turn us on. Either way -- regardless of why we're so narrow sexually 
            -- we're the opposite aesthetically, and especially diverse when it 
            comes to abstract art. One man's electric campfire is another man's 
            bloody cells.</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>Mal acknowledges the grand absurdity of his 
            mission to cure TV numbness with arty videotapes, but he swears the 
            project is no put-on. He is genuinely alarmed that "the sublime is 
            being flattened by the ever-more-perfect relationship with media. 
            Anyone can find something to entertain them and they could watch it 
            forever. To respond to that, I thought, why not reverse the 
            equation, come up with an aesthetics that would be deflective rather 
            than attractive. And if it works, it would heighten sexual response, 
            because it would create a negative space inside this flattened 
            one-dimensional world."</PARA> </P>
            <P class=storyCopy><PARA>Even if deflection doesn't globally 
            overthrow attraction -- a fairly good possibility -- "Blind Heat" 
            and Exoptic Fields' videos could work locally, Mal says. "Our 
            product is made as something you exchange. Somebody hands the tape 
            to someone and says, 'Here's a video that's made to make you look 
            away.' Maybe the person laughs, but they also think about its 
            opposite, about how most media works on you."</PARA> </P><BR
