<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>reversing media logic </b><br>
  You may understand media reversal and deflection by comparing it to sound wave 
  cancellation. One way to understand media reversal and deflection is to compare 
  it to sound wave cancellation, where, as in a bath tub, equal and opposite waves 
  neutralize each other leading to still waters, or silence in the case of sound. 
  The action, its process, removes stimulation. <a href="#reversing">More on media

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>project origins</b> <br>
  The ambient revolution idea sprang from Willy Mal's enthusiasm for the rapid
  changes that occurred in TV, including the news, during the 1980s. The
  striking progression of sensation-driven TV programming promised to
  undermine TV's authority in public life and, under the transformations
  wrought by the ongoing ambient revolution, to transform TV into nothing more
  or less than an ambient emotion emitter with a selection dial.

  Let me tell you how the daylight soothed our eyes. All night we tell you how 
  we fought and . . . <a href="manifesto.html" target="_self">Complete manifesto.</a> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a name="the_project"></a><b>the 
  blind eye project's mission</b><br>
  <b>The project</b> seeks to promote techniques for benign sensory negation-"deflection"-in 
  electronic media. Such deflective media strive to subtract all stimulation. 
  And by so reversing the fundamental principle of nearly all media-attraction/stimulation-, 
  the project seeks to provoke radical departures in thinking and design on par 
  with those that followed the development of expressionist painting and the discovery 
  of microbial life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this regard the project is old 
  fashioned and like any previous avant-garde in proposing to flip Art and Media 
  on their heads, as these have been understood throughout human history. It advocates 
  a complete aesthetic inversion that might lead to a practical, even decorative, 
  liberatory aesthetic for our time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus, through mass-market sales, 
  the blind eye project seeks to provoke artists, media professionals as well 
  as ordinary consumers to think outside the box about the box, and media in general, 
  by reversing media logic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a name="high_concept_gift"></a>novelty 
  gift as high concept </b> </font><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In many regards this is an art project. 
  But one that's most eager to sell videotapes as novelty gifts to non-art-world 
  people. In fact, the laughter and understandings or confusions that arise from 
  such gift exchanges are the essence of the project's public presentation. High 
  concept as mass market gift item without condescending irony.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> These videos work best as a gift 
  because when you personally hand over one of these videos to someone, you emphasize 
  its intention. Which is primarily "deflection." As in, "Here, check this out 
  you lazy couch-potato. It's actually tv made-on purpose-to make you look away!" 
  That's why the exoptic fields box is like a greeting card. Because inciting 
  conversation about media deflection and reversal is more important than the 
  video content itself. </font></p>

  <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The ambient revolution idea sprang 
  from willy mal's enthusiasm for the rapid changes that occurred in TV, including 
  the news, during the 1980s. The striking progression of sensation-driven TV 
  programming promised to undermine TV's authority in public life and, under the 
  transformations wrought by the ongoing ambient revolution, to transform TV into 
  nothing more or less than an ambient emotion emitter with a selection dial. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This revolution required no agitators. 
  Over the years the idea evolved in correspondence and conversation among a small 
  group of movie-media producers and intellectuals. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the mid-1990s, mal proposed marketing 
  videos called "look away TV" as an extension of the ambient revolution, but 
  he found no backers. That work on "look away TV" became the foundation of "the 
  blind eye project." But the blind eye project went beyond the ambient revolution 
  by recognizing contemporary movie-media producers as the greatest seducers of 
  all time. And by realizing that this continuous seduction in media called for 
  its opposite. The original "look away TV" recognized this idea of reversal but 
  not its implications. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then, in 1997, after a secret all-night 
  conference of self-described media druids and moguls in a San Francisco mansion 
  over the Pacific, willy mal formulated a critical departure in the blind eye 
  manifesto. It was useless to deny the joys of perfectly attractive and diverse 
  media. So why resist? Why? Because from inside the all absorbing mediasphere 
  there is no way to observe it, no critical outpost from which to check its progress. 
  Therefore, to gain such critical distance the blind eye project advocated total 
  media reversal. A complete media logic flip. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In early 2000, willy mal set up 
  blind eye media, llc, to produce the following: <br>
  o An example of purely deflective media and a new word to describe it-the exoptic 
  fields video <br>
  o A serious and funny gift item with broad appeal.<br>
  o An example of deflective media with added stimulation, the "blind heat" video 
  made by Benton C. <br>
  o Featuring "exoptic fields" in the TRANSCINEMA festival at the HERE art gallery 
  in New York City end of November 2000. <br></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="#top">back to the top</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>extended discussion</b> <br>
  The "ambient revolution" was also a response to spirited mid-1980s debates about 
  "public interest" television. The revolution saw TV evolving into a kind of 
  pure emotion emitter with a selection dial that viewers could use like a pump 
  for an undiluted emotion-altering drug. And that made reforming television to 
  serve the public interest futile. In this analysis, TV was simply not suited 
  for education or serious politics. Just consider TV coverage of recent, year 
  2000 national political conventions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the ambient revolutionary way 
  of thinking, the so-called MTV-ization of TV and increasingly sensational TV 
  news reporting were good for a democratic society because these trends undermined 
  the authority of a medium that is inherently bad as a forum for analyzing and 
  debating important social questions. That's why the ambient revolution needed 
  no agitators. "Natural" market pressures to pull in larger audience shares and 
  profit-driven changes in technology have been demolishing serious TV for twenty 
  years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The blind eye project makes no intellectual 
  excuses for inaction. It advocates and carries out media reversal as a radical 
  departure from the expanding and heaving and fabulous media monstrosity that's 
  on the verge of encompassing more and more of humanity's daily experience. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With media reversal, the blind eye 
  project flips the idea of media upside down, entirely breaking away from the 
  stalemate over "good" versus "bad" media. But not breaking away in order to 
  "kill your TV"-though that's always a good option. Instead, the blind eye project 
  advocates an active media position entirely outside existing media frameworks. 
  But one that makes useful electronic media. One where media's first objective 
  is to SUBTRACT stimulation in the visual field, usually by deflection. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Media reversal, or negation, pops 
  the media issue out of the conventional media loop. Outside, where the project 
  works to inspire an aesthetic movement. A movement with new pleasures. A movement 
  that's tough enough to disrupt and resist the electronic media juggernaut that's 
  now enveloping human life around the globe for better or worse. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="#top">back to the top</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a name="reversing"></a>media-logic 
  reversal payoff </b><br>
  One speculative consequence of media negation, or subtracting stimulation, can 
  be to heighten the experience of remaining sensations. In other words, media 
  reversal proposes an aesthetics and tools that promote experiences OTHER than 
  those offered by the media themselves! That is the reversed media logic payoff. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>reversing media logic compared 
  to sound wave cancellation </b></font><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One way to think about media reversal 
  and deflection is to compare them to sound wave cancellation. In helicopter 
  headphones, noise is canceled by reproducing inverted sound waves that match 
  the cockpit's loud ambient sounds. This works the same way waves sometimes meet 
  in water and suddenly go flat behind passing boats. Waves with energy pulling 
  in opposite directions cancel each other out. Though light waves or particles 
  that stimulate the sensation of vision may act similar to sound waves, this 
  analogy is not perfect. To literally cancel what comes from a TV or movie screen 
  would require anticipating and broadcasting equal and opposing light waves simultaneously. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The blind eye project doesn't attempt 
  to literally cancel light waves, but this ideal of perfectly negating the screen 
  is central to the project. As is the idea that by negating a the field of visual 
  stimulation, all other stimulation might be heightened. </font></p>
