Dear AVI,Everything is linked to images in the root folder, the link to the graphics folder came to me too late as the site was already done. The link to the quicktime movie is accurate as I grabbed it from the actual site. I did not use a template as the typography varied from page to page, but I will include a notation for the server side apps at the end of the tables. I did not include any meta-tag information as I do not know how Scott wants to handle that, although I recommend that there be some meta information. Everything you need is contained in this zip file except the quicktime movie which is referenced prperly in the preview_movie.html.Great working with you, I await to hear your critique on my design/layout.917-361-7735peace, love, and soul.-mikep.s. I still have your stictly ballroom movie, I stole is back from the fool who stole it from me.
