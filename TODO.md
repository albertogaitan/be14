#TODO
1. nav menu items pile over each other when window's reduced
1. ~~Mouse-over drop-down items should left justify, not center under head menue item~~
1. ~~item "Exhibitions | Shows" should not wrap, if it must, then the "|" should become an "m" dash and the second line should be indented~~
1. ~~spacing btwn items, eg, "Texts," should be uniform, currently the first gap is much greater than that btwn others~~
1. all of the backsplash images look muddy and much darker than earlier?
1. ~~Website page descriptive text looks like it's being smashed by some width fixer - see attached screen grab~~
1. Exhibition ==> Press ==> Salon page margins are off.
